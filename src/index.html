            // we are using .createElement() method.

            // This method is what allows us to create elements in React behind the sense in the frame work.

            // As you can see .createElement() is a method from the React lib.

            // .createElement() takes in 3 arguments.

            // 1st argument is the type of element you wish to create.

            // 2nd argument is an object that will take in any number of properties. The 
            // properties and values passed in can be attribues such as class, id or props.

            // 3rd argument is the childnode if any. In this case we setting raw text (becomes a text  node)
            // on our newly created <div>
            
            // We then use return to return our created element just like we did in our frame work when
            // we used functional components. 

            // To sum it up we are creating <div> with no attributes or props and attaching text to the <div>
